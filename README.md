Technology has been developing for many years so people can use it in their daily life and make their life style much easier. 
When we say technology, we are talking about artificial intelligence that depends, in one way or another, on programming.
We all use this language in everything around us without even knowing it.
The biggest problem Lebanese people are facing every day, is waiting in turn in most of the governmental departments, which is still depending on the old filing system.
Time is money. To save time and money, all the governmental departments and social services must forget what does paper mean and be always up-to-date. 
In my project, I try to give a new beginning for the filing system that can be used in land sectors. Some of benefits are merging and splitting lands. 
Using this system, people can know all the information they need of any land using search.
Also, they will be able to sell / buy any land and register it in the government. As for engineers and contractors, it will help them take any license to their work without spending any time waiting in turn.
this project is done by moamen hamdan and lorence khalefeh for oop project in beirut arab university during semester 2 as computer science student.
